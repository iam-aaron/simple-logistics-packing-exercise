# simple-logistics-packing-exercise
This mini project is the output from my technical interview homework in one of my job application.
PS. I have no prior experience in using Typescript.

### Stack
* [NodeJS] v15.3.0
* [npm] 7.0.14
* [Typescript] Version 4.1.2

### How to run this program
* install node (and npm which is installed together with it)
* Open a terminal
* install typescript
sudo npm install -g typescript
* npm init 
* npm install --save-dev lite-server
* npm start
* Open another terminal
* run tsc -w
* visit http://localhost:<assignedport>/helloworld.html
open developer tools -> console, you should see "HELLO WORLD FROM TYPESCRIPT" if you were able to make things work properly.
  
Will try to improve the documentation later.
